In the documentation directory, you'll find:

- `build.txt`: Building Hedwig, or how to set up Hedwig
- `user.txt`: User's Guide, or how to program against the Hedwig API and how to
  run it
- `dev.txt`: Developer's Guide, or Hedwig internals and hacking details

These documents are all written in the [Pandoc] dialect of [Markdown].  This
makes them readable as plain text files, but also capable of generating HTML or
LaTeX documentation.
