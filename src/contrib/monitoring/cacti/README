Check Chapter 16: Simplest Method of Going from Script to Graph
    http://www.cacti.net/downloads/docs/html/how_to.html#SCRIPT_TO_GRAPH

WARNING: I have wrote these instructions while installing and configuring the plugin on my desktop computer running Ubuntu 9.10. I've installed Cacti using apt-get.

WARNING: I'm going to make the assumption that you know how to work with Cacti and how to setup Data Input Methods for custom scripts. I'm also going to assume that you have already installed Cacti and everything works as expected.

You can extend the Cacti's data gathering functionality through external scripts. Cacti comes with a number of scripts out of the box wich are localted in the scripts/ directory. 


The check_zookeeper.py script can be used a  custom data input method for Cacti.

Single value (check cluster status by sending queries to the leader):
---------------------------------------------------------------------

python <path_cacti>scripts/check_zookeeper.py -s "localhost:2181,localhost:2182,localhost:2183,localhost:2184,localhost:2185" -k <key> -o cacti --leader

When you will call the script this way it will about a single value representing the value attached to this <key>.


Multiple values (one for each cluster node):
--------------------------------------------

python <path_cacti>scripts/check_zookeeper.py -s "localhost:2181,localhost:2182,localhost:2183,localhost:2184,localhost:2185" -k <key> -o cacti

Output:
localhost_2182:0  localhost_2183:0  localhost_2181:0  localhost_2184:0  localhost_2185:0
