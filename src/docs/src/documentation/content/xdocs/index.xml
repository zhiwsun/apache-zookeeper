    <title>ZooKeeper: Because Coordinating Distributed Systems is a Zoo</title>
  </header>
  
  <body>
    <p>
ZooKeeper is a high-performance coordination service for distributed applications. It exposes common services - such as naming, configuration management, synchronization, and group services - in a simple interface so you don't have to write them from scratch. You can use it off-the-shelf to implement consensus, group management, leader election, and presence protocols. And you can build on it for your own, specific needs.

<p>
The following documents provide concepts and procedures to get you started using ZooKeeper. If you have more questions, please ask the <a href="ext:lists">mailing list</a> or browse the archives.
