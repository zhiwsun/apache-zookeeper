<title>Migration Instructions when Upgrading to 3.0.0</title>

<para>
<emphasis>You should only have to read this section if you are upgrading from a previous version of ZooKeeper to version 3.0.0, otw skip down to <ulink url="#changes">changes</ulink></emphasis>
</para>

<para>
A small number of changes in this release have resulted in non-backward compatible Zookeeper client user code and server instance data. The following instructions provide details on how to migrate code and date from version 2.2.1 to version 3.0.0.
</para>

<para>
Note: ZooKeeper increments the major version number (major.minor.fix) when backward incompatible changes are made to the source base. As part of the migration from SourceForge we changed the package structure (com.yahoo.zookeeper.* to org.apache.zookeeper.*) and felt it was a good time to incorporate some changes that we had been withholding. As a result the following will be required when migrating from 2.2.1 to 3.0.0 version of ZooKeeper.

<section id="migration_code">
<title>Migrating Client Code</title>

<para>
  The underlying client-server protocol has changed in version 3.0.0
  of ZooKeeper. As a result clients must be upgraded along with
  serving clusters to ensure proper operation of the system (old
  pre-3.0.0 clients are not guaranteed to operate against upgraded
  3.0.0 servers and vice-versa).
</para>

<section>
<title>Watch Management</title>

<para>
In previous releases of ZooKeeper any watches registered by clients were lost if the client lost a connection to a ZooKeeper server.
This meant that developers had to track watches they were interested in and reregister them if a session disconnect event was recieved.
In this release the client library tracks watches that a client has registered and reregisters the watches when a connection is made to a new server.
Applications that still manually reregister interest should continue working properly as long as they are able to handle unsolicited watches.
For example, an old application may register a watch for /foo and /goo, lose the connection, and reregister only /goo.
As long as the application is able to recieve a notification for /foo, (probably ignoring it) the applications does not to be changes.
One caveat to the watch management: it is possible to miss an event for the creation and deletion of a znode if watching for creation and both the create and delete happens while the client is disconnected from ZooKeeper.
</para>

<para>
This release also allows clients to specify call specific watch functions.
This gives the developer the ability to modularize logic in different watch functions rather than cramming everything in the watch function attached to the ZooKeeper handle.
Call specific watch functions receive all session events for as long as they are active, but will only receive the watch callbacks for which they are registered.

 <listitem><para>In case you start ZooKeeper 3.0 without upgrading from 2.0 on a 2.0 database - the servers will start up with an empty database.
 This is because the servers assume that &lt;dataDir&gt;/version-2 and &lt;dataLogDir&gt;/version-2 will have the database to start with. Since this will be empty
 in case of no upgrade, the servers will start with an empty database. In such a case, shutdown the ZooKeeper servers, remove the version-2 directory (remember
 this will lead to loss of updates after you started 3.0.)
 and then start the upgrade procedure.</para></listitem>

There is a significant change to the ZooKeeper server configuration file.

<para>The default election algorithm, specified by
  the <emphasis>electionAlg</emphasis> configuration attribute, has
  changed from a default of <emphasis>0</emphasis> to a default

<para>
  You will either need to explicitly

  your <emphasis>server.X</emphasis> options to include the leader
  election port.
