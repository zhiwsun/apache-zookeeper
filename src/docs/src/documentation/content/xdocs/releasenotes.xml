<title>Migration Instructions when Upgrading to 3.0.0</title>

<para>
<emphasis>You should only have to read this section if you are upgrading from a previous version of ZooKeeper to version 3.0.0, otw skip down to <ulink url="#changes">changes</ulink></emphasis>
</para>

<para>
A small number of changes in this release have resulted in non-backward compatible Zookeeper client user code and server instance data. The following instructions provide details on how to migrate code and date from version 2.2.1 to version 3.0.0.
</para>

<para>
Note: ZooKeeper increments the major version number (major.minor.fix) when backward incompatible changes are made to the source base. As part of the migration from SourceForge we changed the package structure (com.yahoo.zookeeper.* to org.apache.zookeeper.*) and felt it was a good time to incorporate some changes that we had been withholding. As a result the following will be required when migrating from 2.2.1 to 3.0.0 version of ZooKeeper.
