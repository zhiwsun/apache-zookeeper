                     Zookeeper C client library 


This package provides a C client interface to Zookeeper server. For general
information about Zookeeper please see http://zookeeper.wiki.sourceforge.net/.
The homepage for this project is http://sourceforge.net/projects/zookeeper/.


OVERVIEW

The client supports two types of APIs -- synchronous and asynchronous.

Asynchronous API provides non-blocking operations with completion callbacks and 
relies on the application to implement event multiplexing on its behalf.

On the other hand, Synchronous API provides a blocking flavor of zookeeper operations 
and runs its own event loop in a separate thread.

Sync and Async APIs can be mixed and matched within the same application.

The package includes two shared libraries: zookeeper_st and zookeeper_mt. The former
only provides the Async API and is not thread-safe. The only reason this library
exists is to support the platforms were pthread library is not available or not stable
enough (i.e. FreeBSD 4.x). In all other cases the applications will be better off by
linking against zookeeper_mt as it includes support both Sync and Async API.


INSTALLATION

If you're building the client from a check-out from SourceForge repository, you
need to
1) do a "ant compile_jute" from the zookeeper top level directory (.../trunk/zookeeper).
   This will create a directory named "generated" under zookeeper/c. 
2) change directory to the zookeeper/c and do a "auroreconf -i" to bootstrap 
   autoconf, automake and libtool. Please make sure you have autoconf version 2.59
   or greater installed.
3) do a "./configure [OPTIONS]" to generate the makefile. See INSTALL for general information
   about running configure. Additionally, the configure supports the following options:
   --enable-debug     enables optimization and enables debug info compiler options,
                      disabled by default
   --without-syncapi  disables Sync API support; zookeeper_mt library won't be built,
                      enabled by default
   --disable-static   do not build static libraries, enabled by default
   --disable-shared   do not build shared libraries, enabled by default
4) do a "make" or "make install" to build the libraries and install them.
 

USING THE CLIENT

You can test your client by running a zookeeper server (see instructions on 
the project wiki page on how to run it) and connecting to it using one of 
the cli applications that were built as part of the installation procedure.
cli_mt (multithreaded, built against zookeeper_mt library) is shown in this example, 
but you could also use cli_st (singlethreaded, built against zookeeper_st library):

$ cli_mt zookeeper_host:9876

This is a client application that gives you a shell for executing simple zookeeper
command. Once succesully started and connected to the server it displays a shell prompt. 
You can now enter zookeeper commands. For example, to create a node:

> create /my_new_node

To verify that the node's been created:

> ls /

You should see a list of node who are children of the root node "/".
(TODO: document all the cli commands)

In order to be able to use the zookeeper API in your application you have to
1) remember to include zookeeper header 
   #include <zookeeper/zookeeper.h>
2) use -DTHREADED compiler option to enable Sync API; in this case you should
   be linking your code against zookeeper_mt library

Please take a look at cli.c to understand how to use the two API types. 
(TODO: some kind of short tutorial would be helpful, I guess)
